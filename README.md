# Wheel-Of-Shakespeare


Before running in cmd, you may need to change the active console code page for the ASCII art to function properly.  
Do this by entering ```chcp 65001``` in the console.  


Store the .txt (containing Shakespeare lines) in the same directory as the .py.

If you want to rename the .txt, edit the .py accordingly (Line 172).
